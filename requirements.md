# Take-Home Challenge: Personal Blogging Platform

## Welcome!

We're thrilled to have you tackle our take-home challenge. This task is designed to give you a taste of our tech stack and to showcase your skills in developing a full-stack application. Don't stress if you're not yet fully comfortable with every technology listed; we value your ability to learn and adapt.

## Project Overview

You will be creating a simple blogging platform. This platform will allow users to manage (create, view, edit, delete) blog posts. It's an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and your ability to deploy on Vercel.

## Requirements

As you build the blogging platform, consider the following user stories as your primary requirements:

- **As a user, I want to view a list of all blog posts so that I can choose which post to read.**
  - Implement a homepage that lists all blog posts. Each post should display its title and a brief summary.
  - Each list item should have a "Read More" link that takes the user to the full post.

- **As a user, I want to create a new blog post so that I can share my thoughts and experiences.**
  - Provide a "Create Post" form with fields for the post title and content.
  - After submission, the post should be saved to the database, and the user redirected to the homepage.

- **As a user, I want to delete my blog posts so that I can remove content that is no longer relevant.**
  - Add a "Delete" button on the post's page that, when clicked, will remove the post from the database and redirect the user back to the homepage.

- **As a user, I want to navigate easily between the homepage, the create post form, and individual blog posts for a smooth experience.**
  - Implement a simple navigation bar or menu with links to the homepage and the "Create Post" form.
 
- _(BONUS)_ **As a user, I want to edit my blog posts so that I can correct mistakes or update information.**
  - On the post's page, include an "Edit" button that leads to a form where the user can update the title and content of the post.
  - After saving the changes, the user should be redirected back to the updated post.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to style your application. Aim for a clean, responsive design.
- **Backend**: Utilize Prisma for ORM and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your application on Vercel and ensure it is accessible online.

## Submission

- Provide a link to your GitHub repository containing the project code.
- Include a link to the deployed application on Vercel.
- Your repository README should contain instructions on how to run the project locally and any other necessary documentation.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to user stories and requirements.
- Code quality, including readability, structure, and documentation.
- Functionality of the CRUD operations.
- Design aesthetics and responsiveness of the UI.
- Successful deployment and accessibility of the application.

We're excited to see your implementation and how you approach solving these user stories. Good luck, and have fun with the challenge!
