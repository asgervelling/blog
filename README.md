# Blog

### Live
At https://blog-indol-alpha-35.vercel.app/

### Installation
First, you should be a part of the Vercel organization, so you
have access to the environment variables. \
You will need git, docker and the Vercel CLI.

```bash
# Get code and dependencies
git clone git@github.com:temp-organization-123/blog.git
cd blog
npm install
```

##### Connect to Vercel Project
Run

```bash
vercel link
```

to link your folder to project on Vercel.
Choose the following values when prompted

```bash
Vercel CLI 33.5.3
? Set up “~/path/to/blog”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope should contain your project? temp-organization-123
? Found project “temp-organization-123/blog”. Link to it? [Y/n] y
✅  Linked to temp-organization-123/blog (created .vercel)
```

Now you are able to safely get our environment variables for
the development environment, as specified in the settings of our
Vercel project

```bash
vercel env pull .env
```

### Run the application
```bash
# Start the postgres container in detached mode.
# Requires sudo unless docker is installed in rootless mode.
sudo ./start-database.sh

# Apply Prisma migrations
npm run db:push

# Run the application
npm run dev
```

### View data
If you want to view and interact with your local data from postgres, prisma provides
a web GUI you can open with
```
npm run db:studio
```
